<h1>Browser Test Suite</h1>

<p>This test suite is designed as a developer tool for determining why
the web viewer may fail to work on some browers.  Within this test
suite are all CSS constructs and JavaScript events that are required
by the web viewer, each conveniently separated out into an individual
test module.  Thus, when the web viewer is found not to work on one
browser, this test suite can be consulted to determine the exact
problem feature that caused the web viewer to fail.</p>

<p>Note that JavaScript core language features and JavaScript
libraries written for this project are not to be tested by this test
suite.  The normal test suite takes care of testing those features.
As a rule of thumb, any browser features that pertains to the GUI in
which the user is a human and not a computer should be encapsulated in
this test suite, and everything else related to coding internals
should go in the normal test suite.</p>

<p>Large and significant third-party JavaScript libraries <em>may</em>
be candidates for inclusion in this test suite.  Of course, this only
for simply pass/fail assessment of third party libraries: third party
libraries should have detailed test information indicating what
browsers they work on and why they don't work on other browsers.</p>
