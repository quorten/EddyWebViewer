<h1>Browser Test Template HTML Page</h1>

<p>This is a template that specifies the form that browser HTML test
pages should have.  A browser HTML test page should be structured so
that it is easy for a human to manually verify that features required
by the web application are working on the target browser.</p>

<!-- What do I need to test?

* Various forms of CSS box layout and rendering.

* JavaScript event handling.

Here's how to setup a namespace:

if (typeof OeViewer == 'undefined') {
  var OeViewer = {};
} else {
  throw namespace already defined error;
}

http://hint.fm/wind/wind-bundle.js

OeViewer.func1 = function(param1, param2) {
}

# Just use lat and lon for latitude and longitude in your code.

For class constructors, you can use the following:

Class = function(p1, p2) {
}

# JavaScript allows you to use `this'.

Make sure you separate event handler links from the actual body
markup.

How are the tests organized?

Test one feature of CSS at a time.

No, no, no, most tests will be bundled together, but they have to be
"exploded" so that they are seen as clearly separate modules that
either pass or fail the specific test at hand.

There is HTML prose before the test that describes how the test should
behave, possibly an image too that shows exactly how the results
should look, and then there is the specifically marked test HTML
below.  Then a developer has to manually go through the test files to
verify that the browser tests pass or fail.  JavaScript internal code
tests may be able to be automated, provided that raw lossless data is
available to verify the results of some of the tests. -->
