  <h1>About Ocean Eddies Web Viewer</h1>

<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This version of the
Ocean Eddies Web Viewer is not quite fully complete.</span></p>

<p>At the moment, there is currently no user-level documentation
available for this web viewer.</p>

<p>Caveats with this version of the viewer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The viewer needs to download all 39 MB of tracks data during
  initial startup.</li>
  <li>In order to play the eddies data as an animation, you'll need a
  network connection that 1) has enough bandwidth to download the SSH
  data dynamically and 2) has a relatively low latency access link to
  this site.  Otherwise, you'll just have to contend with stepping
  through the data one frame at a time.</li>
  <li>There are a few missing features that would be nice to have.</li>
</ul>

<p>Direct keyboard and mouse commands (those not accessed from GUI
controls):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click and drag on the map to pan.</li>
  <li>Mouse wheel to zoom.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tab, shift+tab, space bar, and enter keys can be used to access
the GUI controls from the keyboard.</p>
