  <h1>About Ocean Eddies Web Viewer</h1>

<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This is a ALPHA version
of the Ocean Eddies Web Viewer!</span></p>

<p>At the moment, there is currently no user-level documentation
available for this web viewer.</p>

<p>You'll need a lot of RAM to run this viewer, something like 1 GB
of <em>spare</em> RAM.  You'll also need to make sure that you have a
fast enough network connection to download 80 MB of data in less than
30 seconds, since the viewer needs to download all of the tracks data
ahead of time.  These issues cannot be fixed until the next
version.</p>

Good luck and have a great day!
