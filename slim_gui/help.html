<h1>About Ocean Eddies Web Viewer</h1>

<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This is an ALPHA
version of the Ocean Eddies Web Viewer!</span></p>

<p>At the moment, there is currently no user-level documentation
available for this web viewer.</p>

<p>Caveats with this alpha version of the viewer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You'll need a lot of RAM to run this viewer, something like 1 GB
  of <em>spare</em> RAM.</li>
  <li>You'll also need to make sure that you have a fast enough
  network connection to download 80 MB of data in about one minute,
  since the viewer needs to download all of the tracks data ahead of
  time.</li>
  <li>The viewer is not as fast at rendering as it could be.</li>
  <li>Performance on different browser/OS configurations varies more
  wildly than would be the case with better cross browser/platform
  code.  A non-Windows operating system running Google Chrome provides
  the best performance for this alpha version.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues cannot be fixed until the next version.</p>

<p>This page will eventually contain more extensive user
documentation, as is best practice for application development.  Some
features/behaviors of the software may be non-obvious to a new user.
But according to James Faghmous, "They're all going to be
oceanographers, so they'll know."  You better know, then.  For now,
the user documentation will be excluded, but this is a strong regret
for the author of the web viewer.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>

<h3>What are mesoscale ocean eddies?</h3>

<p>Mesoscale ocean eddies are swirling disturbances in the ocean's
water that are on the scale of 10 kilometers to 200 kilometers in
diameter.  These eddies influence a three-dimensional region of the
ocean that extends from the ocean's surface to a depth of 20 to 40
meters, and the eddy lasts from 14 days to 6 months before
disintegrating.  Mesoscale ocean eddies are classified by their
rotational direction as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cyclonic eddies: <strong>Counterclockwise</strong> in the
  northern hemisphere (and clockwise in the sothern hemisphere)</li>
  <li>Anticyclonic eddies: <strong>Clockwise</strong> in the northern
  hemisphere (and counterclockwise in the sothern hemisphere)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why are these eddies important?</h3>

<p>Ocean eddies influence the intensity and distribution of various
parameters of the ocean, such as heat, salt concentration, nutrients,
color, kinetic energy, subsurface density, and sea surface height.
Consequentially, marine ecosystems are also influenced by mesoscale
ocean eddies.  For example, "one study found that 7000-year-old coral
reefs were asphyxiated due to massive phytoplankton blooms, which were
enhanced by a large eddy [24]."</p>

<p>Because eddies are also the dominant source of the ocean's kinetic
energy, they have a significant influence on other phenomenon that
carry large amounts of kinetic energy, such as hurricanes.  For
example, "some of the recent devastating landfalling hurricanes,
including Hurricane Katrina, gained intensity in the Gulf of Mexico
when passing over a warm-core eddy [18].  As a result, hurricane
intensity forecasts now account for eddy activity when making
projections [25]."</p>

<p>Accurately identifying and tracking mesoscale ocean eddies is
crucial for understanding the future of marine and terrestrial
ecosystems.</p>

<h3>How are the eddies identified?</h3>

<p>Our methods use a suite of algorithms to automatically identify
mesoscale ocean eddies by their effect on the sea surface height (SSH)
data obtained from satellites.  Cyclonic eddies cause a depression in
the sea surface height, whereas anticyclonic eddies cause an elevation
in the sea surface height.  Most eddies' height variations are within
the range of +/- 32 centimeters from the mean sea surface height.  The
resolution of the SSH maps that our algorithms use is 0.25 degrees of
latitude/longitude per SSH sample, so our algorithms identify eddies
that are 100 kilometers in diameter or larger and have a minimum
amplitude of one centimeter.</p>

<p>For more information on the identification algorithms, see the
publications.</p>

<h2>Minimum System Requirements</h2>

<p>What are the minimum system requirements to run the interactive web
viewer?  It's interesting that you would even dare ask such a
question on today's Internet&hellip;</p>

<h3>A Brief Review of the Trend in Modern Software</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the growing trend in modern software is to not
correctly specify the minimum system requirements.  Oh sure, a
"modern" computer is all you need.  Define modern, please?  Uh, well,
just go to a big-box store near you and buy a new computer there.  It
will work as long as it is recent.  Recent, as in new enough to run
the latest versions of popular browsers, in addition to antivirus
software that would consume a prohibitive amount of system resources
on older computers.  Right&hellip; most individual computer owners
would rather buy a new computer to run the latest browsers and
antivirus software than "learn Linux," as they say.  (For those who
really know free and open-source software, there's more complications
than this, but those aren't worth covering here.)</p>

<p>In any case, if you're one of those people who went out and bought
a new computer, then for all you care, there are no minimum system
requirements for this web application and no finite list of supported
browers either, any browser running on any computer will do.</p>

<p>If that's not the case, or you want more in-depth coverage of why
the web application performs the way it does on your computer, then
read on&hellip;</p>

<h3>The Fundamental Issues of the Web Platform</h3>

<p>The web platform is not the world's best software development
platform.  Although modern open-source web browsers are developed in
Unix environments of paramount quality that boast record-breaking
uptime figures, web browsers themselves are not Unix.  Thus, the
discussion of system requirements starts not with what the web
platform has, but what it has not.</p>

<p><strong>Web browsers do not have formalized system
requirements.</strong>  How many megabytes of RAM do you need to run a
web browser?  Does the memory have to literally be main memory RAM?
What are the memory speed requirements for virtualization?  How do you
plan a shared display server that can host N user browser
sessions?  <em>These are all questions that go unanswered by modern
browser developers.</em>  Browser development is too informal to
provide hard and strong answers to these questions.  Really, the only
answer that browser developers provide is "however much it takes to
get the browser to run reasonably fast."  In other words, the browser
platform itself is a major hog of system resources that must be
factored into consideration.  Once you've got a browser running on a
system that is powerful enough to provide subjectively reasonable
performance for browsing average web pages, the next issue
ensues&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>The web platform makes no provisions for web applications
to know the order of magnitude of real system resources that they are
consuming.</strong>  Suddenly, the web application's automatic
benchmarking system notices a jerk in elasped time from its
performance timers.  Was the jerk caused by over-computation within
the application?  Is the web application using so much memory that it
is causing the browser's memory to swap to disk?  Or was the jerk
simply caused due to a surge in CPU consumption caused by other
concurrent processes on the system?  No one will ever know: the user
will not have the patience to diagnose the exact problem themself and
the browser fails to provide sufficient system diagnostics to a web
application for it to automatically diagnose and respond to the real
problem.</p>

<p><strong>The two core technologies of web applications, DOM and
JavaScript, are both extremely memory inefficient.</strong>  To make
matters go from bad to worse, in addition to web applications being
unable to determine real memory consumption, for every logical byte of
data managed via JavaScript objects, the real memory consumption can
be over 20 times larger in some scenarios.  A notable exception to
this trend is large JavaScript string objects.</p>

<p><strong>The web platform does not provide a reliable de facto
standard for feature detection.</strong>  Newer browsers introduce
additional features, but not all new browsers include all features
from every other new browser, and it is important to write scripts
that can gracefully handle the absence of an extended feature.
Although there are <em>de jure</em> standardized ways of checking
whether a browser supports a certain named feature, a long history of
many browsers not correctly implementing the standard has effectively
rendered it useless.  Thus, web developers must resort to other, often
less reliable, methods to test if a feature exists in the current
browser.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into consideration, it's very hard indeed
accurately detail hardware system requirements for a web application.
Browser requirements, on the other hand, can at least be specified and
checked for in crude detail, for as much detail as the browser allows
the web application to glean.</p>

<h3>Ways around the Issues of the Web Platform</h3>

<p>For hardware requirements, simple order of magnitude estimates can
be made rather than measurements of ideal detail.  Most conventional
application software depends more on the size and speed of the RAM
than the speed of the CPU.  This has been a long observed trend: users
of older computers often find that they can get average application
performance to match that of newer computers simply by upgrading the
RAM.  Is this true for web browers?  You bet!  Due to the multiple
memory inefficiencies of web browsers documented above, browsers
definitely demand large amounts of high speed RAM, pushing all
recommendations for best software development practices aside.  The
fundamental design concepts behind web browsers that can support web
applications simply don't allow them to be memory efficient.  Although
I'm not an expert on the internals of browsers, I think its safe to
say that browers definitely aren't the kind of software whose entire
working set, or even only the working set that the browser spends 80%
of time processing, can fit entirely within 2 MB of CPU cache.
Usually, the bandwidth of main memory is slower than the bandwidth of
cache memory, so if a program exhibits a behavior of simply accessing
bytes in sequence or at random for a chunk of memory that is larger
than the cache size, the performance of the program will be
effectively limited to the speed of the main memory.</p>

<h3>Finally, the Requirements!</h3></p>

<p>128 MB of memory that can be random accessed at a speed of 17056
MB/second.</p>

<p>Beyond the minimum requirements, the web app makes use of feature
detection to enable various niceties.  This manual will document all
such features along the way, making use of JavaScript to interactively
inform you of whether your browser has support of the feature in
question or not, using the exact same feature detects that are used by
the web application at startup.</p>

<p>Include this as an appendix, please, just before the end.</p>

<p>And if you thought that was interesting to learn about, then you
should move on to the <a>developer documentation.</a></p>

<h2>HTML Canvas</h2>

<p>Your browser
<span id="hts" style="color: white; background-color: #cc0000">
does not support</span> this feature.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
(function() {
  var hts = document.getElementById('hts');
  var tcanv = document.createElement('canvas');
  if (tcanv.getContext && tcanv.getContext('2d')) {
    hts.style.cssText = 'color: white; background-color: green';
    hts.innerHTML = 'supports';
  }
})();
</script>

<p>HTML Canvas rendering renders graphics via a raster graphics
interface.  The performance will depend on the efficiency of your
browser's implementation of the functions.</p>

<p>Just do an overview of the features to finish off, that's all, like
a text-based tour of the software, you know.  But you need the
software to be finished for that to work.</p>
