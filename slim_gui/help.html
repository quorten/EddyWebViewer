  <h1>About Ocean Eddies Web Viewer</h1>

<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This is an ALPHA
version of the Ocean Eddies Web Viewer!</span></p>

<p>At the moment, there is currently no user-level documentation
available for this web viewer.</p>

<p>Caveats with this alpha version of the viewer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You'll need a lot of RAM to run this viewer, something like 1 GB
  of <em>spare</em> RAM.</li>
  <li>You'll also need to make sure that you have a fast enough
  network connection to download 80 MB of data in about one minute,
  since the viewer needs to download all of the tracks data ahead of
  time.</li>
  <li>The viewer is not as fast at rendering as it could be.</li>
  <li>Performance on different browser/OS configurations varies more
  wildly than would be the case with better cross browser/platform
  code.  A non-Windows operating system running Google Chrome provides
  the best performance for this alpha version.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues cannot be fixed until the next version.</p>

<p>This page will eventually contain more extensive user
documentation, as is best practice for application development.  Some
features/behaviors of the software may be non-obvious to a new user.
But according to James Faghmous, "They're all going to be
oceanographers, so they'll know."  You better know, then.  For now,
the user documentation will be excluded, but this is a strong regret
for the author of the web viewer.</p>
