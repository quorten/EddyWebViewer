  <h1>About Ocean Eddies Web Viewer</h1>

<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This is an ALPHA
version of the Ocean Eddies Web Viewer!</span></p>

<p>At the moment, there is currently no user-level documentation
available for this web viewer.</p>

<p>Caveats with this alpha version of the viewer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You'll need a lot of RAM to run this viewer, something like 1 GB
  of <em>spare</em> RAM.</li>
  <li>You'll also need to make sure that you have a fast enough
  network connection to download 80 MB of data in about one minute,
  since the viewer needs to download all of the tracks data ahead of
  time.</li>
  <li>The viewer is not as fast at rendering as it could be.</li>
  <li>Performance on different browser/OS configurations varies more
  wildly than would be the case with better cross browser/platform
  code.  A non-Windows operating system running Google Chrome provides
  the best performance for this alpha version.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues cannot be fixed until the next version.</p>

<p>This page will eventually contain more extensive user
documentation, as is best practice for application development.  Some
features/behaviors of the software may be non-obvious to a new user.
But according to James Faghmous, "They're all going to be
oceanographers, so they'll know."  You better know, then.  For now,
the user documentation will be excluded, but this is a strong regret
for the author of the web viewer.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>

<h3>What are mesoscale ocean eddies?</h3>

<p>Mesoscale ocean eddies are swirling disturbances in the ocean's
water that are on the scale of 10 kilometers to 200 kilometers in
diameter.  These eddies influence a three-dimensional region of the
ocean that extends from the ocean's surface to a depth of 20 to 40
meters.  These eddies' structure last from 14 days to 6 months before
disintegrating.  Mesoscale ocean eddies are classified by their
rotational direction as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cyclonic eddies: Counterclockwise rotation in the northern
  hemisphere, clockwise rotation in the sothern hemisphere</li>
  <li>Anticyclonic eddies: Clockwise rotation in the northern
  hemisphere, counterclockwise rotation in the sothern hemisphere</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why are these eddies important?</h3>

<p>Ocean eddies influence various characteristics of the ocean, such
as heat, salt, nutrients, color, kinetic energy, subsurface density
surfaces, and sea surface height.  Consequentially, marine ecosystems
are also influenced by mesoscale ocean eddies.  For example, "one
study found that 7000-year-old coral reefs were asphyxiated due to
massive phytoplankton blooms, which were enhanced by a large eddy
[24]."</p>

<p>Eddies are also the dominant source of the ocean's kinetic energy,
thereby influencing other phenomenon that carry large amounts of large
kinetic energy.  For example, "some of the recent devastating
landfalling hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina, gained intensity
in the Gulf of Mexico when passing over a warm-core eddy [18].  As a
result, hurricane intensity forecasts now account for eddy activity
when making projections [25]."</p>

<p>Accurately identifying and tracking mesoscale ocean eddies is
crucial for understanding the future of marine and terrestrial
ecosystems.</p>

<h3>How are they identified?</h3>

<p>Our methods use a suite of algorithms to automatically identify
mesoscale ocean eddies by their effect on the sea surface height (SSH)
data obtained from satellites.  Cyclonic eddies cause a depression in
the sea surface height, whereas anticyclonic eddies cause an elevation
in the sea surface height.  Most eddies' height variations are within
the range of +/- 32 centimeters from the mean sea surface height.  The
resolution of the SSH maps that our algorithms use is 0.25 degrees of
latitude/longitude per SSH sample, so our algorithms identify eddies
that are 100 kilometers in diameter or larger and have a minimum
amplitude of one centimeter.</p>

publications.</p>
