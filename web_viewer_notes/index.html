<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">
    Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The goal of the Ocean Eddies Web Viewer is to make the data from
the Ocean Eddies project more accessible to a wider audience.  The
Eddy Web Viewer should be very well designed so that all of the
following hold true:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The data can be accessed from a large variety of browsers, all
  the way down to Firefox 3.6, Internet Explorer 6, and versions of
  Safari from 2004.</li>
  <li>The viewer is easy to use.</li>
  <li>The viewer has an attractive look, feel, and feature set.  Think
  Google Earth: the viewer will have both 2D and 3D map views.</li>
  <li>The viewer has to be fast and responsive: high resolution images
  should be broken up into tiles and loaded individually.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are some links to general resources for this project.</p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="intro_interact" id="intro_interact">Interactivity
Basis</a></h3>

<p>The primary technology that will be used to provide interactive
user interface elements within the web browser will be using
JavaScript to manipulate Dynamic HTML.  Interactive display of
graphics will be handled by a variety of different technologies.</p>

<p>For 2D vector graphics, there are four choices for display, listed
in order from least compatibility issues to most compatibility
issues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SVG</li>
  <li>HTML Canvas</li>
  <li>VML (Internet Explorer Only)</li>
  <li>WebGL</li>
</ol>

<p>3D graphics can be achieved through either manual projection before
rendering 2D vector graphics, per-pixel ray tracing of textures onto
an HTML Canvas, or through WebGL GLSL pixel shaders.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_graph_render" id="intro_graph_render">
    Graphics Rendering</a></h3>

<p>Interactive graphics rendering for the sea surface height and
eddies on the Earth poses a variety of design challenges from
compatibility to performance.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render the land masses of the Earth.</h4>

<p>Land details are not really important for the Eddy Web Viewer,
mostly so that you can see the nearby continents.  Thus, only outlines
of the land masses need to be rendered, although rendering textured
land masses isn't that much harder.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render the eddy paths and boundaries.</h4>

<p>Eddy paths and boundaries need to be updated dynamically when the
user changes display settings.  Rendering vector graphics on demand is
probably a better idea than storing the prerendered paths in a
backbuffer.</p>

<h4>Problem: Rendering lots of vector graphics can be slow.</h4>

<p>Solution: Have the default settings only show a few vector
graphics.  Only render what is within the viewing bounds.  Decrease
vector graphics density at low zoom levels.  Draw less geometry during
globe rotation and zoom.</p>

<h4>Problem: Old JavaScript interpreters can be slow.</h4>

<p>Solution: Careful testing and benchmarking of the JavaScript in the
essential loop paths.  Preliminary testing has shown that handwritten
JavaScript, as opposed to JavaScript from libraries such as D3.js, can
have sufficient performance even on old JavaScript interpreters.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render the sea surface heights of the Earth on a 2D
map.</h4>

<p>Solution: HTML Canvas rendering JavaScript should yield sufficient
performance.  Otherwise, the image maps can be pre-generated on the
server and downloaded by the browser.  Notably, modern versions of
Internet Explorer have a slower Canvas rendering performance than
other modern browsers.</p>

<h4>Problem: Downloading large datasets can be slow.</h4>

<p>Solution: Break up large images into tiles that are loaded one at a
time and combined on the local computer.  Break up large numeric
datasets into multiple files and prioritize loading of high resolution
data at the position that is currently visible to the user.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render an orthgraphic projection of the Earth as a
globe.</h4>

<p>Solution: HTML Canvas provides sufficient performance for this
task.  For GPU-enabled computers, a WebGL GLSL pixel shader can be
used for even higher performance.</p>

<h4>Problem: Internet Explorer 6 does not support the HTML
Canvas.</h4>

<p>The ExplorerCanvas JavaScript library can be used as a
compatibility wrapper to emulate an HTML Canvas by using VML.
However, ExplorerCanvas cannot emulate getImageData() and
putImageData(), so 3D texture mapping will have to be disabled when
using ExplorerCanvas.</p>

<h4>Problem: There is a lot of variation in the features that browsers
support.</h4>

<p>Solution: Maintain a browser feature test suite that individually
tests each component feature in the browser.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_min_req" id="intro_min_req">
    Minimum Browser Requirements</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript (1.5) interpreter</li>
  <li>HTML 4.01</li>
  <li>Web developers: XHTML 1.0</li>
  <li>CSS 1</li>
  <li>Raster image display</li>
  <li>Dynamic vector graphics rendering, either SVG, VML, or HTML
  Canvas</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="intro_ftr_missing" id="intro_ftr_missing">
    Features not available when only minimum requirements are met</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>3D Textured Earth View</li>
  <li>Local download and processing of Sea Surface Height data</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to support browsers that cannot perform tasks like
downloading and rendering the Sea Surface Height directly, the server
will also need to meet a minimum requirement of providing batch
processing of any new data to generate the necessary image maps.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_max_req" id="intro_max_req">
    Maximum Useful Browser Requirements</a></h3>

<p>A browser/computer system that exceeds these requirements will have
no additional advantages when using the Eddy Web Viewer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>High performance JavaScript interpreter</li>
  <li>HTML 5</li>
  <li>CSS 2.1</li>
  <li>Raster image display</li>
  <li>Vector graphics rendering, preferably SVG</li>
  <li>Full support for HTML 5 Canvas.  Support for getImageData() and
  putImageData() raster operations on HTML Canvas.</li>
  <li>WebGL, GPGPU hardware acceleration</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="intro_old_support" id="intro_old_support">
    Why bother supporting older browsers?</a></h3>

<p>The thing about communication services is they involve sending
messages to other people's devices, and because those devices
are <em>their</em> devices, not yours, you generally cannot force an
immediate change to the device.  Because of various restrictions such
as IT department policies where the actual owner of the device is not
the user of the device, if you require them to change their hardware
or software to access your site, you're probably going to just end up
chasing away a potential user.  There is really a "take it or leave
it" ethic if you want to get the message across with communication
technologies.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_core_js_lib" id="intro_core_js_lib">
    Core JavaScript Libraries</a></h3>

<p>These are a variety of JavaScript libraries or libraries that
process JavaScript code that are likely to prove useful for the
implementation of the Eddy Web Viewer.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a pentagon by plotting 5 points on a circle, each spaced
  by 72 degrees.  Each vertex should be one unit distance from the
  center.  Connect the points to form the pentagon.</li>

  <li>Pick one edge of the pentagon.  Draw two lines from the center
  of the pentagon to each vertex of the chosen edge.  Draw a line from
  the center of the pentagon to the median of the edge.  Note that
  this forms a bisected isosceles triangle, which means (a) the two
  halves are right triangles, (b) the interior angle of each right
  triangle at the center of the pentagon is exactly 36 degrees, and
  (c) trigonometry can be used to determine the length of the chosen
  edge of the pentagon.</li>

  <li>Use trigonometry to determine the length of the chosen edge of
  the pentagon:<br />
  sin(36&deg;) &times; 2 = 1.17557050458</li>

  <li>Use trigonometry to determine the length of the line that
  bisects the chosen edge:<br />
  cos(36&deg;) = 0.809016994375</li>

  <li>Determine the additional length needed to extend the bisecting
  line from the chosen edge of the pentagon to the circumference of
  the circle:<br />
  1 - cos(36&deg;) = 0.190983005625</li>

  <li>Using trigonometry, determine the altitude that the center
  vertex of the pentagon should be elevated to form the "top" five
  equilateral triangles in the icosahedron:<br />
  sin(acos(1/1.17557050458)) &times; 1.17557050458 = 0.618033988739
  </li>

  <li>The "bottom hat" of the icosahedron should be identical to the
  "top hat", except that it is rotated 36 degrees from the orientation
  of the "top hat" and points down rather than up.</li>

  <li>The two "hats" will be connected with a series of equilateral
  triangles.  Each triangle will have one of its edges connect to the
  "top hat" and the opposite vertex connect to the "bottom hat".  Each
  such triangle will be tilted at an angle such that when looking at
  the icosahedron flattened from above, the X-Y planar distance
  between the median of the edge on one hat and the vertex on the
  other will be equal to the distance calculated in step 5.  With this
  information, a right triangle can be formed that extends
  horizontally out by the distance from step 5 and has a hypotenuse
  (running along the length of one of the new triangles to be added)
  equal to the length from step 4.  Trigonometry can then be used to
  calculate the vertical Z-axis distance between the rims of the
  hats: <br />
  cos(asin(0.190983005625/0.809016994375)) &times; 0.809016994375 =
    0.786151377757</li>

  <li>Center and scale the vertices so that each vertex is one unit
  distance from the origin of the coordinate system.</li>

  <li>Skin the faces on the calculated vertices to create the complete
  3D model of the icosahedron.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="projections" id="projections">
    Projections</a></h2>

<p>The primary metrics used to indicate the positions on the Earth in
the eddies dataset are latitude and longitude.  In order to
interoperate this data with other data such as maps of the Earth and
rendering on screen, <em>projection methods</em> are needed.  The only
logic needed by the eddy web viewer for projections are two abstract
functions for each projection class: a <code>project()</code> method
and an <code>unproject()</code> method.  <em>Projection</em> is
defined as translating a latitude and a longitude into a Y and X
coordinate, and unprojection is the reverse operation.</p>

<h3>Map Projections</h3>

<p>Some datasets of the Earth, such as images of the land masses, are
often be stored in 2D image-based formats.  The following summaries of
common map projections are useful to know when dealing with such
images:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Equirectangular projection:</strong> Simply maps
  latitude angles linearly along the Y-axis of the image and longitude
  angles linearly along the X-axis of the image.</li>
  <li><strong>Mercator projection:</strong> A cylindrical projection
  that stretches the map vertically at high and low latitudes in order
  to preserve projected angles (a conformal map).<br /> 
  X-coordinates map linearly to longitudes.<br />
  Y-coordinate to latitude mapping: y = R ln [ tan(&pi;/4 + &phi;/2) ]
  (R = radius = 1)<br />
  Latitude to y-coordinate mapping: &phi; = 2 atan[exp(y/R)] - &pi;/2
  (R = radius = 1)<br />
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>3D Rendering Projections</h3>

<p>First of all, what factor distinguishes a 3D projection from a 2D
projection?  For the purposes of this application, it is basically the
need to carry around three of some kind of position variables in the
projection/unprojection equations.  Tilting the pole of the globe
before projection computations basically requires three-dimensional
mathematics in the intermediate equations.</p>

<p>Raytrace rendering a 3D view of the Earth is less trivial than one
would think at first.  The process of backtracing from screen pixels
to a a map pixel is a multistep process.</p>

<p class="image-flow">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="orthographic.svg"
	width="202" height="142">
  <img src="orthographic.png" alt="Orthographic projection diagram"

	width="202" height="142">

	width="202" height="142">
  <img src="angle_measure.png" alt="Angle measurement diagram"
       width="202" height="142" />
</object>
</p>

<ol>
<li>The first step of the process is to backtrace from a screen pixel
to a point on a generic globe that the pixel maps to.  The main point
of this process is to determine a vector from the center of the globe
to this point.  To keep things simple, assume this vector will be
represented as a normalized 3-dimensional rectangular vector.  The
coordinate system at this step will be assumed to have the X-Y plane
coincide with the screen, with the 3D origin (0, 0, 0) at the center
of the screen and quadrant I of the X-Y plane at the top-right corner.
The camera will be looking down the negative Z-axis, and the center of
the globe will lie on the Z-axis.</li>

<li>Once a vector describing the point on the globe in relation to the
center has been found, the vector should be inverse rotated by the
current rotation of the Earth to generate a vector that describes a
position on the Earth.  It is critical that the pole tilt
transformation is the independent transformation and the longitudinal
rotation transformation is the dependent transformation.</li>

<li>Now it is possible to determine the latitude and longitude of the
point.  The longitude can be determined by using <code>atan2()</code>
on a normalized vector from the X and Z coordinates, and the latitude
can be determined by using <code>sin()</code> on the Y
coordinate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Projection rendering vector geometry is basically the reverse
process, except that there is one additional step: after transforming
the geometry, determine if the projected point is visible or not.  If
it is not visible, don't render it.</p>

<p>The specific mathematics used for backtracing a ray or projecting a
vector in step 1 depends on whether perspective is used for rendering
or not.</p>

<h4 style="clear: left">Orthographic Projection</h4>

<p class="image-flow" style="float: left">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="orthographic.svg"
	width="202" height="142">
  <img src="orthographic.png" alt="Orthographic projection diagram"
       width="202" height="142" />
</object>
</p>

<p>Orthographic projection is simply a flattening of 3D geometry onto
a 2D plane of a sufficiently large size to contain the 3D geometry.
To obtain the necessary rectangular vector for step 1 above, the X and
Y offsets from the center of the globe are simply the same as the X
and Y offsets from the center of the projection plane, and the Z
offset along the direction of projection can be obtained via
<code>sin(acos(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)))</code>.</p>

<h4 style="clear: left">Perspective Projection</h4>

<p class="image-flow">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="perspective.svg"
	width="244" height="142">
  <img src="perspective.png" alt="Perspective projection diagram"
       width="244" height="142" />
</object>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="persp_graph2d.svg"
	width="202" height="202">
  <img src="persp_graph2d.png" alt="2D perspective graph"
       width="202" height="202" />
</object>
</p>

<p>Perspective projection operates by tracing straight lines from an
object through the screen to the <em>focal point</em>, the point
behind the screen where all lines converge.  For rendering the Earth,
it is primarily used for aesthetic purposes to make the rendered Earth
look like it does from geosynchronous orbit.  To get a physically
accurate rendering of how the Earth looks from geosynchronous orbit,
these two parameters are essential: the mean radius of the Earth
(6371.0 km) and the altitude of geosynchronous orbit (35,786 km).</p>

<p>Given a pixel screen coordinate, it is somewhat more difficult to
solve for the point on the generic globe with perspective projection
than is the case with orthographic projection.  However, by
simplifying the problem into two 2D cases, one for the X coordinate
and the other for the Y coordinate, it can be easily seen that this is
only a problem of solving for the intersection between a line and a
hemicircle.  A system of two equations in two unknowns can be setup
and the quadratic formula can be used on the resulting equation.
Since only a hemicircle is considered, only one of the two solutions
of the quadratic formula needs to be considered.  The solution process
is mathematically written below:</p>

<!-- BAD BAD!  Many old browsers have no way of figuring out the
actual height of an embedded HTML object, so we must code in a
reasonable height manually.  Maybe there is some browser setting that
I don't know about that limits the maximum intrinsic height of
embedded objects. -->
<p style="text-align: center">
<object type="application/xhtml+xml" data="persp_math1.xhtml"
	width="100%" height="678">
<img src="persp_math1.png" alt="raster mathematics rendering"
     width="604" height="678" />
</object>
</p>

<p>A similar equation can be derived for Y coordinates by substituting
the relevant variables in the above solution.  Once the X and Y
coordinates of the point on the generic globe have been found, the Z
coordinate can be found by using <code>z = sin(acos(sqrt(x^2 +
y^2)))</code>, the same equation given above for the orthographic
projection.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the above simplification of considering the X and Y
coordinates separately is incorrect.  Look at it this way: Suppose you
have a point on the Z axis located a distance "r + d" away from the
center of a sphere.  Try drawing a plane through the equator of the
sphere and the point on the Z axis.  You'll get a circular
cross-section with radius "r" just as expected from the equations
above.  Now suppose you tilt that plane around the Y axis, making sure
the plane still passes through the distanced point on the Z axis.  The
cross-section of the sphere that lies on the plane will end up having
a radius smaller than "r".  Thus, the above algorithm cannot be used
for X and Y independently, since that computational method is
flawed.</p>

<p>Luckily, it turns out that the solution with a 3D sphere equation
is not that much more difficult.  Starting with the equation of a
sphere and two equations for X and Y screen coordinates, the Z
coordinate on the sphere is solved for, which gives the quadratic
formula.  Only the "near" solution needs to be considered, since the
"far" solution is occluded by the front of the sphere.  After the Z
coordinate on the sphere is found, the X and Y coordinates of the
point on the sphere can be trivially found using the X and Y ray
equations.</p>

</object>
</p>

<h3>Display Considerations</h3>

<p>All of the above algorithms assume that there is no rotation along
the axis that points directly away from the viewer.  Any such rotation
along this axis would simply result in the 2D image onscreen appearing
at a different rotation.  Thus, it is not necessary to factor this
rotation into these calculations that are concerned with the more
difficult math.  If there is any rotation along this axis, then an
inverse rotation can simply be used to preprocess the screen
coordinate before backtracing it to the globe.</p>

<h2><a name="imp_center" id="imp_center">
    Implementation Center</a></h2>

<p>Overall, the implementation of the web viewer is divided into three
main areas: the CSS user interface (GUI), the renderer, and data
I/O.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CSS User Interface</li>
  <li>Renderer</li>
  <li>Data I/O</li>
</ul>

<p>This design pattern (or a similar design pattern) is more often
called Model/View/Controller (MVC), but for the purposes of this code,
the names of the modules will be the names indicated above.</p>

<p>Since this is a web application rather than a traditional "native"
application, a few extra components are also necessary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browser-side browser compatibility layer</li>
  <li>Server-side browser compatibility layer</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of the above components are used exclusively to work around
limitations in the browser's JavaScript interpreter.</p>

<h3>CSS User Interface</h3>

<p>The overall design of the CSS user interface will be composed of a
central rendering/touchscreen area surrounded by two optional, hidable
panels: a top panel (topbar) and a side panel (sidebar).</p>

<p>The old MATLAB tracks viewer looked like this:
  <code><a href="matlab_eddy_viewer.png">
      matlab_eddy_viewer.png</a></code></p>

<h4>General User Interface Design Requirements</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The UI needs to be able to consistenly respond when the user
  presses the escape key.</li>
  <li>The UI should provide a convenient keyboard user interface.</li>

  not moving the mouse will select an eddy if it is visible.</li>
  <li>Clicking and dragging the mouse pans the Earth.</li>
  <li>Rolling the mouse wheel forward zooms in, rolling it backward

<h3>Renderer</h3>

<p>The renderer contains the logic for projecting and unprojecting
coordinates.  These modules are also used by the UI scripts to
determine the latitude and logitude from a pixel selected on
screen.</p>

<p>The renderer needs to provide fast wireframe rendering of the
grid and land masses for scrolling the maps.</p>

<p>The renderer needs to provide special rendering modes for rendering
"2D" projections.  2D projections are the projections that do not need
to compute the inverse tilt transformation in three dimensions.  These
projections are special because it is possible to support a wider
range of browser compatibility with these projections than is the case
for the 3D projections.</p>

<p>For the 3D projections, there is a 2D backbuffer where SSH, land
masses, and track rendering is performed on.  At higher zoom levels,
this backbuffer will need to be rendered at a higher resolution.  At
the same time, only a smaller portion of the map will be visible.
Thus, for a responsive UI, only the visible portion of the map should
be rendered.  Also, it is not practical to store very high resolution
maps prerendered, so the backbuffer will act as a local cache in this
case, only storing prerenders for closely surrounding areas at the
same zoom level.  In order for this to work well, a quadtree or
kd-tree is also needed to quickly lookup only the eddies that are
within the visible map area.</p>

<h3>Data I/O</h3>

<p>This part of the web viewer handles loading of data that is
possibly segmented into multiple files on the server.  It can also
provide mechanisms for exporting rendered raster/vector images and
exporting image sequences that can be used for animations.</p>

<p>There can also be a <em>server-side</em> data I/O component that is
primarily used to segment large datasets into individual files for
bandwidth optimized data downloading.  This would only be necessary if
(1) the dataset needs to be parsed serially as opposed to random
access and (2) low-level (HTTP) protocol control cannot be achieved by
the web viewer.</p>

<h3>Web Development</h3>

<p>Many modern browsers disable or severely impair scripts from HTML
read from regular files on the filesystem.  As far as the web browser
knows, the DocumentRoot of the "website" is just the root of the
filesystem, which is considered very insecure.  Although it is
sometimes possible to configure the web browser to have different
security settings, this cannot be done efficiently with different
versions of the same browser.  Thus, serverless web development won't
get you anywhere for working on this web application and you'll need
to have a web server setup for testing the web application.</p>

<h3>Mathematics on the Web</h3>

<p>NOTE: Mathematics display is not necessary for the viewer, but it
is helpful for this documentation.</p>

<p>Although there was one point in the past where MathML was well
supported by majority browsers, modern browsers are neglecting good
functions for mathematics display.  MathML support was dropped from
Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer on Windows 8 does not support
plugins like MathPlayer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shouldn't annoy researchers. They'll all gang up on you and
  it wont be pretty</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/google-subtracts-mathml-from-chrome-and-anger-multiplies/">
    http://www.cnet.com/news/google-subtracts-mathml-from-chrome-and-anger-multiplies/</a></p>

<p>Although MathJax has been reported to result in a slower
mathematics browsing experience than MathML, there are ways around
this.  Rather than using LaTeX equations in your HTML documents with
MathJax, you should first convert them to MathML and insert the MathML
in your documents.  Then load the MML_HTMLorMML config for MathJax on
your webpage.  This will result in MathJax using the browser's native
MathML display when it is of sufficient quality and falling back to
HTML output otherwise.  MathML-to-HTML translation is considerably
faster than LaTeX-to-intermediate-to-HTML translation.</p>

<h3>SVG Compatibility</h3>

<p>For best backwards compatibility support, avoid text and clones in
SVG images.  Also note that older versions of Firefox (3.6) treated
SVG images as "documents" and did not support including SVG images in
a document via the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.  Note that when
an SVG image is included in a document via
the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element rather than via
the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element or some other inlining method,
there are a
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_as_an_Image#Restrictions">
    variety of limitations applied to the SVG image.</a></p>

<h3>HTML Compatibility</h3>

<p>Make sure your browser is sending the right charset in the HTTP
Content-Type headers for the character set; otherwise, you are not
going to be able to read extended characters correctly.</p>

<h3>XHTML Compatibility</h3>

<p>HTML presents many breaking changes from HTML 4.01.  Here is a list
of the changes and links to additional resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to make sure your web server is setup to serve XHTML
  documents with "application/xhtml+xml".<br />
  Setup Apache to server XHTML: <br />
  <a href="http://protempore.net/~calvins/howto/xhtml-apache/">
    http://protempore.net/~calvins/howto/xhtml-apache/</a></li>

      http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200501/the_perils_of_using_xhtml_properly/</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>CSS Compatibility</h3>

<p>Dealing with vertical space is very difficult in CSS.  The
solutions also tend to cause a lot of problems with cross-browser
compatibility.  The most reliable way to perform vertical space
operations such as vertically centering a box or expanding a box to
fill up all of its available space is to write a script to perform the
task.  One such script is included in the browser test suite.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer 6 also has an almost entirely different box model
than is described by the CSS Specification.  The details are described
in the next section.</p>

<h3>Internet Explorer Compatibility</h3>

<p>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5-8 are long known to cause
many more problems for web developers than equivalent older versions
of other browsers.  This is made worse by the fact that Internet
Explorer is also a very popular browser.  Most people are likely using
the latest version of Internet Explorer; however, a key older
version, version 6, is still in use by many people for a variety of
reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>IE6 does not understand XHTML served with the
  "application/xhtml+xml" MIME type or files with a ".xhtml"
  extension:<br />
  <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/html-css/answers/161030-application-xhtml-xml-ie">
    http://bytes.com/topic/html-css/answers/161030-application-xhtml-xml-ie</a></li>
  <li>Detect IE versions for both CSS and JavaScript most flexibly:<br />
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10964966/detect-ie-version-in-javascript">
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10964966/detect-ie-version-in-javascript</a></li>
  <li>IE5 interprets "width" and "height" to mean the content
  width/height, plus the padding, plus the border widths.  IE6 doesn't
  do this when standards-conformant mode is triggered via a DOCTYPE
  declaration.</li>
  <li>You probably cannot go further back in time to support DHTML and
  JavaScript on a browser earlier than Internet Explorer 5.5.</li>
  <li>The display style "inline-block" is incomplete and buggy in IE6.
  Often times, you can get the intended effect if you use "inline"
  instead, but only if you use it in a stylesheet definition, not an
  inline definition.</li>
  <li>Horizontal and vertical centering that is cross-browser to IE6
  requires the techniques described in the following link:<br />
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/396145/whats-the-best-way-of-centering-a-div-vertically-with-css">
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/396145/whats-the-best-way-of-centering-a-div-vertically-with-css</a><br />
  Note that this will not work in IE5.5.
  </li>
  <li>You cannot use both the "top" and "bottom" positioning
  properties at the same time.  Same goes with "left" and "right".  If
  you want to vertically expand a box to fill up its available space,
  then you must write a JavaScript to do that.  Keep in mind the
  differences of box layout between IE5 and IE6 when doing this.</li>
  <li>All versions of IE that support scripting generally support it
  well.  Expect JavaScript 1.5 to be well supported.  However, you
  must take care not to use certain web API scripting idioms that
  won't be supported by IE, such as<br />
    element.setAttribute('style', 'styleText');<br />
  as opposed to<br />
    element.style.cssText = 'styleText';</li>
  <li>Avoid inline styling: Using inline style information can sometimes
  trigger bugs in Internet Explorer that are not present when using
  stylesheets.</li>
  <li>IE6 cannot properly render transparent PNG images.  Use GIF
  images instead.</li>
  <li>IE6 does not
  support <code>document.getElementByClassName()</code>.  Use
    <a href="http://robertnyman.com/2008/05/27/the-ultimate-getelementsbyclassname-anno-2008/">
      Robert Nyman's <code>getElementByClassName()</code></a>
    cross-browser implementation instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>JavaScript Events and Web App Provisions</h3>

<h4>Mouse Pointer Coordinates Compatibility</h4>

<p>When a page has a vertical scrollbar, it can be impossible on some
older browsers to determine where the mouse pointer is located.
Without a vertical scrollbar, it is possible to determine the mouse
pointer's location with a few capability checks.  See the following
link for more information:</p>

<p>Mission Impossible Mouse Coordinates:
  <a href="http://evolt.org/node/23335/">
    http://evolt.org/node/23335/</a>
</p>

<h4>Mouse Wheel Events</h4>

<p>Older browsers had a lot of different ways of handling the mouse
wheel.  The
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/wheel">
    wheel event page on Mozilla Developers Network</a> provides a
good cross-browser compatibility function for handling wheel
events.</p>

<h4>Mouse Capturing Compatibility</h4>

<p>Many browsers do not support the <code>setCapture()</code> method.
The solution to this problem is usually to set up an event handler on
the <code>window</code> object instead, which the browser will
automatically provide mouse capture for.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.qooxdoo.org/mouse-capturing">
  http://news.qooxdoo.org/mouse-capturing</a></p>

<h4>CSS Box Size Change Events</h4>

<p>In modern HTML and CSS, there is no way to listen for an event that
fires when the size of a CSS box changes.  (Older browsers had a
<code>DOMAttrModified</code> event, but it is now
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dom3events/raw-file/tip/html/DOM3-Events.html#event-type-DOMAttrModified">deprecated</a>.)
Instead, the equivalent functionality must be implemented by polling
at a periodic interval to detect changes.  If a script is frequently
called to refresh the contents of an element, the beginning of the
execution of this script would be the most logical place to put such
polling code.  Otherwise, timer timeouts must be used to call the
polling code.</p>

<h4>requestAnimationFrame() Compatibility</h4>

<p>The best possible cross-browser compatibility for
requestAnimationFrame() involves defining a polyfill shim:<br/ >
<a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/">
http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/</a></p>

<p>It is necessary to use <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code> for any
code that gets frequently executed and makes updates to the screen,
such as a pointer motion handling code, in order to get good rendering
performance in modern versions of Firefox.  Otherwise, the graphics
refresh rate in Firefox is going to trail dramatically behind the
graphics refresh rate in Google Chrome.</p>

that all widgets must be within a FORM element, just like has been
demonstrated in the HTML 4 reference on the W3C's website.</p>

<p>Although <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code> poses a number of
advantages over <code>setTimeout()</code>, it has very bad browser
compatibility, so if it is used, it will have to be wrapped in
