<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">
    Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The goal of the Ocean Eddies Web Viewer is to make the data from
the Ocean Eddies project more accessible to a wider audience.  The
Eddy Web Viewer should be very well designed so that all of the
following hold true:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The data can be accessed from a large variety of browsers, all
  the way down to Firefox 3.x, Internet Explorer 6, and versions of
  Safari from 2004.</li>
  <li>The viewer is easy to use.</li>
  <li>The viewer has an attractive look, feel, and feature set.  Think
  Google Earth: the viewer will have both 2D and 3D map views.</li>
  <li>The viewer has to be fast and responsive: high resolution images
  should be broken up into tiles and loaded individually.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="intro_interact" id="intro_interact">Interactivity
Basis</a></h3>

<p>The primary technology that will be used to provide interactive
user interface elements within the web browser will be using
JavaScript to manipulate Dynamic HTML.  Interactive display of
graphics will be handled by a variety of different technologies.</p>

<p>For 2D vector graphics, there are four choices for display, listed
in order from least compatibility issues to most compatibility
issues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SVG</li>
  <li>HTML Canvas</li>
  <li>VML (Internet Explorer Only)</li>
  <li>WebGL</li>
</ol>

<p>3D graphics can be achieved through either manual projection before
rendering 2D vector graphics, per-pixel ray tracing of textures onto
an HTML Canvas, or through WebGL GLSL pixel shaders.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_graph_render" id="intro_graph_render">
    Graphics Rendering</a></h3>

<p>Interactive graphics rendering for the sea surface height and
eddies on the Earth poses a variety of design challenges from
compatibility to performance.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render the land masses of the Earth.</h4>

<p>Land details are not really important for the Eddy Web Viewer,
mostly so that you can see the nearby continents.  Thus, only outlines
of the land masses need to be rendered, although rendering textured
land masses isn't that much harder.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render the eddy paths and boundaries.</h4>

<p>Eddy paths and boundaries need to be updated dynamically when the
user changes display settings.  Rendering vector graphics on demand is
probably a better idea than storing the prerendered paths in a
backbuffer.</p>

<h4>Problem: Rendering lots of vector graphics can be slow.</h4>

<p>Solution: Have the default settings only show a few vector
graphics.  Only render what is within the viewing bounds.  Decrease
vector graphics density at low zoom levels.  Draw less geometry during
globe rotation and zoom.</p>

<h4>Problem: Old JavaScript interpreters can be slow.</h4>

<p>Solution: Careful testing and benchmarking of the JavaScript in the
essential loop paths.  Preliminary testing has shown that handwritten
JavaScript, as opposed to JavaScript from libraries such as D3.js, can
have sufficient performance even on old JavaScript interpreters.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render the sea surface heights of the Earth on a 2D
map.</h4>

<p>Solution: HTML Canvas rendering JavaScript should yield sufficient
performance.  Otherwise, the image maps can be pre-generated on the
server and downloaded by the client.  Notably, modern versions of
Internet Explorer have a slower Canvas rendering performance than
other modern browsers.</p>

<h4>Problem: Downloading large datasets can be slow.</h4>

<p>Solution: Break up large images into tiles that are loaded one at a
time and combined on the local computer.  Break up large numeric
datasets into multiple files and prioritize loading of high resolution
data at the position that is currently visible to the user.</p>

<h4>Problem: Render an orthgraphic projection of the Earth as a
globe.</h4>

<p>Solution: HTML Canvas provides sufficient performance for this
task.  For GPU-enabled computers, a WebGL GLSL pixel shader can be
used for even higher performance.</p>

<h4>Problem: Internet Explorer 6 does not support the HTML
Canvas.</h4>

<p>The ExplorerCanvas JavaScript library can be used as a
compatibility wrapper to emulate an HTML Canvas by using VML.
However, ExplorerCanvas cannot emulate getImageData() and
putImageData(), so 3D texture mapping will have to be disabled when
using ExplorerCanvas.</p>

<h4>Problem: There is a lot of variation in the features that browsers
support.</h4>

<p>Solution: Maintain a browser feature test suite that individually
tests each component feature in the browser.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_min_req" id="intro_min_req">
    Minimum Browser Requirements</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript interpreter</li>
  <li>CSS 2 (possibly support CSS 1 if the differences are manageable)</li>
  <li>Raster image display</li>
  <li>Vector graphics rendering, either SVG, VML, or HTML Canvas</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="intro_ftr_missing" id="intro_ftr_missing">
    Features not available when only minimum requirements are met</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>3D Textured Earth View</li>
  <li>Local download and processing of Sea Surface Height data</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to support browsers that cannot perform tasks like
downloading and rendering the Sea Surface Height directly, the server
will also need to meet a minimum requirement of providing batch
processing of any new data to generate the necessary image maps.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_max_req" id="intro_max_req">
    Maximum Useful Browser Requirements</a></h3>

<p>A browser/computer system that exceeds these requirements will have
no additional advantages when using the Eddy Web Viewer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>High performance JavaScript interpreter</li>
  <li>CSS 2</li>
  <li>Raster image display</li>
  <li>Vector graphics rendering, preferably SVG</li>
  <li>Full support for HTML 5 Canvas.  Support for getImageData() and
  putImageData() raster operations on HTML Canvas.</li>
  <li>WebGL, GPGPU hardware acceleration</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="intro_old_support" id="intro_old_support">
    Why bother supporting older browsers?</a></h3>

<p>The thing about communication services is they involve sending
messages to other people's devices, and because those devices
are <em>their</em> devices, not yours, you generally cannot force an
immediate change to the device.  Considering it is likely that they're
a non-technical person, they're probably going to be ignorant of the
tech news channels that document all the shortcomings of their device,
and if you require them to change their hardware or software to access
your site, you're probably going to just end up chasing away a
potential user.  There is really a "take it or leave it" ethic if you
want to get the message across with communication technologies.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_core_js_lib" id="intro_core_js_lib">
    Core JavaScript Libraries</a></h3>

<p>These are a variety of JavaScript libraries or libraries that
process JavaScript code that are likely to prove useful for the
implementation of the Eddy Web Viewer.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a pentagon by plotting 5 points on a circle, each spaced
  by 72 degrees.  Each vertex should be one unit distance from the
  center.  Connect the points to form the pentagon.</li>

  <li>Pick one edge of the pentagon.  Draw two lines from the center
  of the pentagon to each vertex of the chosen edge.  Draw a line from
  the center of the pentagon to the median of the edge.  Note that
  this forms a bisected isosceles triangle, which means (a) the two
  halves are right triangles, (b) the interior angle of each right
  triangle at the center of the pentagon is exactly 36 degrees, and
  (c) trigonometry can be used to determine the length of the chosen
  edge of the pentagon.</li>

  <li>Use trigonometry to determine the length of the chosen edge of
  the pentagon:<br />
  sin(36&deg;) &times; 2 = 1.17557050458</li>

  <li>Use trigonometry to determine the length of the line that
  bisects the chosen edge:<br />
  cos(36&deg;) = 0.809016994375</li>

  <li>Determine the additional length needed to extend the bisecting
  line from the chosen edge of the pentagon to the circumference of
  the circle:<br />
  1 - cos(36&deg;) = 0.190983005625</li>

  <li>Using trigonometry, determine the altitude that the center
  vertex of the pentagon should be elevated to form the "top" five
  equilateral triangles in the icosahedron:<br />
  sin(acos(1/1.17557050458)) &times; 1.17557050458 = 0.618033988739
  </li>

  <li>The "bottom hat" of the icosahedron should be identical to the
  "top hat", except that it is rotated 36 degrees from the orientation
  of the "top hat" and points down rather than up.</li>

  <li>The two "hats" will be connected with a series of equilateral
  triangles.  Each triangle will have one of its edges connect to the
  "top hat" and the opposite vertex connect to the "bottom hat".  Each
  such triangle will be tilted at an angle such that when looking at
  the icosahedron flattened from above, the X-Y planar distance
  between the median of the edge on one hat and the vertex on the
  other will be equal to the distance calculated in step 5.  With this
  information, a right triangle can be formed that extends
  horizontally out by the distance from step 5 and has a hypotenuse
  (running along the length of one of the new triangles to be added)
  equal to the length from step 4.  Trigonometry can then be used to
  calculate the vertical Z-axis distance between the rims of the
  hats: <br />
  cos(asin(0.190983005625/0.809016994375)) &times; 0.809016994375 =
    0.786151377757</li>

  <li>Center and scale the vertices so that each vertex is one unit
  distance from the origin of the coordinate system.</li>

  <li>Skin the faces on the calculated vertices to create the complete
  3D model of the icosahedron.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="projections" id="projections">
    Projections</a></h2>

<p>The primary metrics used to indicate the positions on the Earth in
the eddies dataset are latitude and longitude.  In order to
interoperate this data with other data such as maps of the Earth and
rendering on screen, <em>projection methods</em> are needed.  The only
logic needed by the eddy web viewer for projections are two abstract
functions for each projection class: a <code>project()</code> method
and an <code>unproject()</code> method.  <em>Projection</em> is
defined as translating a latitude and a longitude into a Y and X
coordinate, and unprojection is the reverse operation.</p>

<h3>Map Projections</h3>

<p>Some datasets of the Earth, such as images of the land masses, are
often be stored in 2D image-based formats.  The following summaries of
common map projections are useful to know when dealing with such
images:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Equirectangular projection:</strong> Simply maps
  latitude angles linearly along the Y-axis of the image and longitude
  angles linearly along the X-axis of the image.</li>
  <li><strong>Mercator projection:</strong> A cylindrical projection
  that stretches the map vertically at high and low latitudes in order
  to preserve projected angles (a conformal map).<br /> 
  X-coordinates map linearly to longitudes.<br />
  Y-coordinate to latitude mapping: y = R ln [ tan(&pi;/4 + &phi;/2) ]
  (R = radius = 1)<br />
  Latitude to y-coordinate mapping: &phi; = 2 atan[exp(y/R)] - &pi;/2
  (R = radius = 1)<br />
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>3D Rendering Projections</h3>

<p>Raytrace rendering a 3D view of the Earth is less trivial than one
would think at first.  The process of backtracing from screen pixels
to a a map pixel is a multistep process.</p>

<p style="page-break-inside: avoid">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="orthographic.svg">
  <img src="orthographic.png" alt="Orthographic projection diagram"
       width="202" height="142" />
</object>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="earth_rotate.svg">
  <img src="earth_rotate.png" alt="Point rotation diagram"
       width="202" height="142" />
</object>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="angle_measure.svg">
  <img src="angle_measure.png" alt="Angle measurement diagram"
       width="202" height="142" />
</object>
</p>

<ol>
<li>The first step of the process is to backtrace from a screen pixel
to a point on a generic globe that the pixel maps to.  The main point
of this process is to determine a vector from the center of the globe
to this point.  To keep things simple, assume this vector will be
represented as a normalized 3-dimensional rectangular vector.  The
coordinate system at this step will be assumed to have the X-Y plane
coincide with the screen and the Z-axis run from the center of the
screen through the center of the globe.</li>

<li>Once a vector describing the point on the globe in relation to the
center has been found, the vector should be inverse rotated by the
current rotation of the Earth to generate a vector that describes a
position on the Earth.  At this step, the coordinate system should
also be transformed so that the X-Y plane coincides with the equator
and the Z-axis runs through the poles.</li>

<li>Now it is possible to determine the latitude and longitude of the
point.  The longitude can be determined by using <code>atan2()</code>
on a normalized vector from the X and Y coordinates, and the latitude
can be determined by using <code>sin()</code> on the Z
coordinate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Projection rendering vector geometry is basically the reverse
process, except that there is one additional step: after transforming
the geometry, determine if the projected point is visible or not.  If
it is not visible, don't render it.</p>

<p>The specific mathematics used for backtracing a ray or projecting a
vector in step 1 depends on whether perspective is used for rendering
or not.</p>

<h4 style="clear: left">Orthographic Projection</h4>

<p style="margin: 0; float: left; clear: left; page-break-inside: avoid">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="orthographic.svg">
  <img src="orthographic.png" alt="Orthographic projection diagram"
       width="202" height="142" />
</object>
</p>

<p>Orthographic projection is simply a flattening of 3D geometry onto
a 2D plane of a sufficiently large size to contain the 3D geometry.
To obtain the necessary rectangular vector for step 1 above, the X and
Y offsets from the center of the globe are simply the same as the X
and Y offsets from the center of the projection plane, and the Z
offset along the direction of projection can be obtained via
<code>sin(acos(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)))</code>.</p>

<h4 style="clear: left">Perspective Projection</h4>

<p style="page-break-inside: avoid" >
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="perspective.svg"
	style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em; vertical-align: top">
  <img src="perspective.png" alt="Perspective projection diagram"
       width="244" height="142" />
</object>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="persp_graph2d.svg"
	style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-right: 0.5em"
	width="202" height="202">
  <img src="persp_graph2d.png" alt="2D perspective graph"
       width="202" height="202" />
</object>
</p>

<p>Perspective projection operates by tracing straight lines from an
object through the screen to the <em>focal point</em>, the point
behind the screen where all lines converge.  For rendering the Earth,
it is primarily used for aesthetic purposes to make the rendered Earth
look like it does from geosynchronous orbit.  To get a physically
accurate rendering of how the Earth looks from geosynchronous orbit,
these two parameters are essential: the mean radius of the Earth
(6371.0 km) and the altitude of geosynchronous orbit (35,786 km).</p>

<p>Given a pixel screen coordinate, it is somewhat more difficult to
solve for the point on the generic globe with perspective projection
than is the case with orthographic projection.  However, by
simplifying the problem into two 2D cases, one for the X coordinate
and the other for the Y coordinate, it can be easily seen that this is
only a problem of solving for the intersection between a line and a
hemicircle.  A system of two equations in two unknowns can be setup
and the quadratic formula can be used on the resulting equation.
Since only a hemicircle is considered, only one of the two solutions
of the quadratic formula needs to be considered.  The solution process
is mathematically written below:</p>

<!-- BAD BAD!  Many old browsers have no way of figuring out the
actual height of an embedded HTML object, so we must code in a
reasonable height manually.  Maybe there is some browser setting that
I don't know about that limits the maximum intrinsic height of
embedded objects. -->
<p>
<object width="100%" height="650"
	type="application/xhtml+xml" data="perspective_math.xhtml">
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="perspective_math.png" alt="[mathematics rendering available]"
     width="604" height="650" />
</div>
</object>
</p>

<p>A similar equation can be derived for Y coordinates by substituting
the relevant variables in the above solution.  Once the X and Y
coordinates of the point on the generic globe have been found, the Z
coordinate can be found by using <code>z = sin(acos(sqrt(x^2 +
y^2)))</code>, the same equation given above for the orthographic
projection.</p>

<h3>Display Considerations</h3>

<p>All of the above algorithms assume that there is no rotation along
the axis that points directly away from the viewer.  Any such rotation
along this axis would simply result in the 2D image onscreen appearing
at a different rotation.  Thus, it is not necessary to factor this
rotation into these calculations that are concerned with the more
difficult math.  If there is any rotation along this axis, then an
inverse rotation can simply be used to preprocess the screen
coordinate before backtracing it to the globe.</p>

<h2><a name="imp_center" id="imp_center">
    Implementation Center</a></h2>

<p>Overall, the implementation of the web interface is divided into
three main areas: the CSS user interface (GUI), the renderer, and data
I/O.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CSS User Interface</li>
  <li>Renderer</li>
  <li>Data I/O</li>
</ul>

<p>This design pattern (or a similar design pattern) is more often
called Model/View/Controller (MVC), but for the purposes of this code,
the names of the modules will be the names indicated above.</p>

<p>A server-side component is also a necessary part of the
implementation.</p>

<h3>CSS User Interface</h3>

<p>The overall design of the CSS user interface will be composed of a
central rendering/touchscreen area surrounded by two optional, hidable
panels: a top panel (topbar) and a side panel (sidebar).</p>

<h4>General User Interface Design Requirements</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The UI needs to be able to consistenly respond when the user
  presses the escape key.</li>
  <li>There will be no "select eddy" button, since just clicking and
  not moving the mouse will select an eddy if it is visible.</li>
  <li>Clicking and dragging the mouse pans the Earth.</li>
  <li>Rolling the mouse wheel forward zooms in, rolling it backward
  zooms out.</li>
  <li>Pulling fingers apart on touchscreen zooms out, pushing fingers
  together zooms in.</li>
  <li>The panels should be able to dynamically hide and show on small
  screen layouts.</li>
  <li>The UI needs to be able to dynamically resize the height on the
  canvas area depending on how much vertical space there is in the
  window.</li>
  <li>There needs to be a legend on the map.  If the colors are to be
  decided by the web application, they need to be specially chosen to
  maximize clarity to colorblind individuals.</li>
  <li>With as many widgets as there are going to be in the user
  interface, there also needs to be a way to iconify the grouping
  boxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the required controls in the CSS user interface:</p>

<h3>Renderer</h3>

<p>The renderer contains the logic for projecting and unprojecting
coordinates.  These modules are also used by the UI scripts to
determine the latitude and logitude from a pixel selected on
screen.</p>

<h3>Data I/O</h3>

<p>This part of the web viewer handles loading of data that is
possibly segmented into multiple files on the server.  It can also
provide mechanisms for exporting rendered raster/vector images and
exporting image sequences that can be used for animations.</p>

<h3>Server-side Component</h3>

<p>The server-side component is likely to primarily be used to segment
large datasets into individual files and pre-render image maps for
browsers that don't have the scripting capabilities to generate them
locally.</p>

    Scratch Style Notes</a></h2>

<p>These are notes that are far less organized than the rest.</p>

<p>Note oversampling.</p>

<p>Note document all APIs and provide examples on basic usage
throughout.</p>

<p>Other mathematical constructs: clipping, bézier smoothing of a
polyline, pixel interpolation (bilinear, bicubic), great circle
subdivision.</p>

<p>Fixed function pipeline, graphics card is not capable of performing
general purpose non-linear computations.</p>

<p>With CSS styling, never set a foreground color without also setting
a background color.  You need to take into consideration that white
page backrounds are an <em>assumption</em>, not a <em>requirement</em>
of web browsers.</p>
